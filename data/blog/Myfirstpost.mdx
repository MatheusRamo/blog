## Introduction

Welcome to the release of Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog template v2.0. This release is a major refactor of the codebase to support Nextjs App directory and React Server Components. Read on to discover the new features and how to migrate from V1.

Many thanks to the community of users and contributors for making this template a success! I created a small video montage of the blogs (while cleaning up the list in the readme) to showcase the diversity of the blogs created using the template and to celebrate the milestone:


Version 2 builds on the success of the previous version and introduces many new features and improvements. The codebase has been refactored to support Next.js App directory and React Server Components. Markdown / MDX is now processed using Contentlayer, a type-safe content SDK that validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON data. It integrates with Pliny, a new library that provides out of the box Next.js components to enhance your static site with analytics, comments and newsletter subscription. A new command palette (âŒ˜-k) search component is also added to the template.

## Typescript First

The codebase has been migrated to Typescript. While the previous version of the template was available in both Javascript and Typescript, I decided to reduce the maintenance burden and focus on Typescript. This also allows for better type checking and code completion in IDEs.

Typescript is also a perfect match with our new type-safe markdown processor - Contentlayer.
